# skateclub

I've been a part of a climbing community in Long Island City in Queens, NY for awhile now. This past summer, a really good friend of mine decided to start a skate club where people can come together to do something fun at a local outdoor rink. Coming from a person who never thought they could skate, my friend created an amazing community that makes so many people happy. 

He mentioned a couple times that it is hard to share the information about what is going on with the club because everyone uses a different platform. So I thought it would be cool to make a website for him that has all the information for easy access. At the end of the day, my goal was to create/design a website where it is easy for people to learn how to join Skate Club.
